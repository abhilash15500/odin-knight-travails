# ♞ Odin Knight Travails  

A project to find the shortest path for a **knight** on a chessboard using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Graph Representation**.  

## What I Learned  
- How to **dynamically calculate valid knight moves**  
- Using **BFS** to find the shortest path  
- Representing the chessboard as a **graph** for efficient traversal  

## How to Use  
```js
knightMoves([0, 0], [7,7]);
// Output: "=> You made it in 2 moves! Your path is: [0,0] [2,1] [3,3]"
